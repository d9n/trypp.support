# trypp.support

**Trypp**, which stands for _Try++_, [is my blog for talking about code][trypp]. `trypp.support` is
a collection of general-purpose Kotlin classes, many of which I wrote for learning / educational
purposes.

In general, I aim to include `README.md` files at the root of each subproject and at the root of
each package as well. Please dive into those sub-READMEs for a more detailed explanation of each
part of the overall picture.
